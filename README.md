**Objectives**

The primary objective for this WP is to create strong awareness of the ModelWriter project and products at European level, with the aim to multiply its impact and subsequent exploitation opportunities. This objective is broken down into the following sub-objectives:

* To establish two-way communication channels between the Consortium members and end-users for disseminating the project deliverables in exhibitions and relevant events.
* To support the promotion of selected project results, including documentation of systems and white papers, in a form that can be understandable and accepted by potential users (and to contact with those that may be potentially interested in purchasing the product or services).
* To evaluate optimal Business Models and define the corresponding Exploitation Plan.
* To share the ModelWriter platform with the scientific community (as per section 3.3.3.3).
* To build and stimulate an on-line knowledge community bringing together organizations and individuals interested in the topic.

**Expected results**

* Exploitation Plan (based on the optimal Business Model) in order to reach the desired market(s).
* A Dissemination Plan.
* Report on standardization activities. 
* ModelWriter-ITEA consortium project website
